# How you 'doin? ðŸ‘‹


Hi I'm **Ace Logronio**, a front end developer. I recently graduated with a degree of **Information Technology** in Bicol University.
My love for programming started when I was a junior high student. I was so confused as to what major I'm going to take in college. 
As I was scrolling through my YouTube feed, `web development` suddenly popped up right in front of my face, so I tried it.
The gratifying feeling of writing something and looking at it materialize as I hit `ctrl + s` was so right in the feelsðŸ˜–.
